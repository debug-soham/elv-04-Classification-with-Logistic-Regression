# Task 4: Classification with Logistic Regression

This task focuses on building a binary classifier using logistic regression. The model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on various features.

## 🎯 Objective  
Build a classification model using logistic regression and evaluate it using relevant metrics and visualizations.

## 🔧 Steps Performed  
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Split data into training and test sets  
- Standardized features for model stability  
- Trained a Logistic Regression classifier  
- Evaluated performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Precision and Recall  
  - ROC-AUC curve  
- Visualized the sigmoid activation function  
- Analyzed and interpreted threshold tuning  

## 📊 Results  
- **Precision**: 0.9762  
- **Recall**: 0.9535  
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.9974
